# Nope to npm
package-lock.json
# Nope to yarn
yarn.lock
# Nope to pnpm because of the following that will happen in the CI:
#
#  ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE  Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with package.json
#  Note that in CI environments this setting is true by default. If you still need to run install in such cases, use "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile"
#
pnpm-lock.yaml
